    "The first step in preprocessing is data exploration. This involves analysing the data's structure, content and relationships. In this step you identify the data types (numerical, categorical, data/time or text). This should always be applied to identify any inconsistensies or errors before moving on to any other preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can apply quality control. This involves removing or correcting any missing or incomplete data. Samples with low expression levels can be filtered out in this step. This step is done to ensure the data is reliable and complete.\n",

    "To make sure the features are in a common range, feature scaling should be applied.This ensures that each feature will contribute equally to the model in later steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "If features are across different scales, normalisation should be applied. This will make sure the features are standardised/ \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, dimensionality reduction can be applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the model. This step should be skipped if the data is low-dimensional or if removing certain features will result in the loss of information that is needed in the model."
